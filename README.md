# Visalytics

VISAs. Anyone who's ever needed one will tell you: they're a pain to get.

Tonnes of paperwork, fees, queues and uncertainty. It's all run by private firms with no accountability. In the meantime, travelers suffer.

## Can we do better?

I believe that with more transparency around VISA outcomes, we'll be able to make better decisions and hold organisation to account.

I'm creating Visalytics for everyone. To log their applications and outcomes anonymously.

## What's the catch?

Trust. Visalytics relies on its users to provide data.

At the time of writing, we have no way to verify that the information is correct. We can only start.
